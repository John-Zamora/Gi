                        hai hehe happy birthday x2 you should really enjoy this day because itâ€™s YOUR DAY.
                        Itâ€™s interesting to see how your birthday lands on the start of intersession â€” itâ€™s
                        like itâ€™s emphasizing the start of a new year for you. Although, time is just a construct
                        (outside the realm of science cause Iâ€™m not too sure now the physicists see time HAHAHAHA
                        do u know cause I wanna know but itâ€™s 4am so I donâ€™t really wanna research.) Sophomore
                        year really tested us and Iâ€™ve seen you do so much for the things you were passionate in.
