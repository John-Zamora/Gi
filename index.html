            Itâ€™s interesting to see how your birthday lands on the start of intersession â€” itâ€™s <br>
            like itâ€™s emphasizing the start of a new year for you. Although, time is just a construct <br>
            (outside the realm of science cause Iâ€™m not too sure now the physicists see time HAHAHAHA <br>
            do u know cause I wanna know but itâ€™s 4am so I donâ€™t really wanna research.) Sophomore <br>
